          <h5 class="text-center font-weight-normal">
              
              The Hall effect thruster is a form of Electric Propulsion used to propel objects through space.  Primarily using the un-reactive noble gas Xenon as fuel it was first utilized on the Deep Space 1 mission which launched October 24, 1998.</h5>

          <h2 class="section-subheading">What is a Hall Effect Thruster?</h2>
          
          <h5 class = "text-left font-weight-normal">The Hall Effect can trace its name back to Mr. Edwin Herbert Hall, an American scientist who discovered the Hall Effect in 1879.

              This is a property that can be applied to electrically conductive material by a magnetic field.  When there is current across a conductor in the presence of a magnetic field the moving charges migrate towards the surface of the material.  Molecules with the opposite charge, positive or negative, outside the conductor then migrate to the conductor’s surface as a result.
              
              <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (11)  </a>
              
              The Hall effect thrusters use this Hall Effect in order to ionize the Xenon Propellant which then due to the electric field is expelled from the thruster at high speeds.
              
              <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (12)  </a>

          <br>
          
          <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal">The Hall Effect Thruster is an ion propulsion system.
              Xenon propellant is essentially fuel composed of Xenon gas.  Although the Hall Effect Thrusters primarily use Xenon, other noble gasses can be used.
              
              <!-- TA02-11 - Ion Thrusters - Xenon Currently Used But Other Propellants Can Be Used -->

              This choice to use noble gasses as propellant is two-fold;
          First, a gaseous propellant weighs substantially less than either liquid or solid propellants.
          Second, noble gasses are inert meaning that if there is a fuel leak or malfunction within the propulsion
          system there is no chance of a fire or explosion occurring.

        <h5 class = "text-left font-weight-normal">
            
            <i class = "quoted">"Space Exploration is about getting somewhere safely (mission enabling), getting there quickly (reduced transit times), getting a lot of mass there (increased payload mass), and getting there cheaply (lower cost). The simple act of 'getting' there requires the employment of an in-space propulsion system, and the other metrics are modifiers to this fundamental action"</i> (Meyer M, et.al. pp. TA02-1, 2010)
            
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (16) </a>
        
        </h5>
        
        <br>
        
        <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal">The debate of electric vs chemical propulsion is a space-based debate.  This is because an electric thruster is not capable of delivering enough acceleration to launch a vehicle into space at this point in time.
            
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (16) </a>
            
            The amount of force they can apply is roughly equal to what is felt holding a stack of 10 quarters or 1 single tennis-ball.
            
            <!-- Stack Of Quarters -->

            As a result all electric propulsion systems are dependent upon chemical propulsion to get them into space.
            
            <!-- Ion Thrusters can't get into space on their own -->

            Once we are in space however there are a number of advantages to electric propulsion over chemical propulsion.</h5>
        
        <br>
        
        <h5 class="text-left font-weight-normal">Before the comparison begins it is necessary to point out that all forms of propulsion in space are only able to accelerate the vehicle in one single direction.  This comes down to the laws of physics and the fact that force can only be applied to a single point at a time.  Cars are able to change direction by changing the direction the front wheels are facing.  During this change the engine is still causing the wheels to rotate applying force in all directions between the initial and final trajectories that the wheels and therefore the car is facing.  In space the rocket engine just like a car’s engine applies its force in the direction that the craft is facing.  Because there is no road to push against to steer a vehicle in space other engines must be present at different angles on the craft to align it with the desired direction of travel.  To this end the main engines are what moves the space-craft forward whereas the reaction control and orbital maneuvering systems are what function to the effect of steering the craft.
            
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (16) </a>
        
        </h5>
        
        <br>
        
        <h5 class = "text-left font-weight-normal">
            
            The comparison of electric and chemical thrusters also concerns a concept of Specific Impulse.  Specific Impulse is defined as the provided thrust divided by both the weight of the object and the duration of thruster operation.
            
            <!-- Definition Of Specific Impulses -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (17) </a>
            
            Thrust is the force that moves a rocket and so Specific Impulse can be thought of the ratio of force moving an object to the weight of an object over a period of time.  Using a standardized period of time in its calculation it becomes possible to compare chemical and electric propulsion forms.  One of the main drawbacks of chemical propulsion is that it has relatively low values of Specific Impulse.
            
            <!-- Stated That Chemical Thrusters Have Low Specific Impulses TA02-1-->
           <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (16) </a>
           
           Ion Thrusters, the class of Electric Thruster which the Hall Effect Thrusters belong, have high specific impulses meaning that more thrust is applied per unit weight of the craft.
           
           <!-- Ion Thrusters Have High Specific Impulses -->
           <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (12) </a>
            
        </h5>
        
        <br>
        
        <h5 class = "text-left font-weight-normal">Now, on the topic of comparison of electric vs chemical propulsion first let us consider the solid-propellant based chemical thruster.  Solid-propellant thrusters for example are the type of propellant that is used in a model rocket.
            
            <!-- Solid Rocket Engines Are Used ... On Model Rockets -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (19) </a>
            
            Anyone who has ever launched a model rocket can tell you that once they launch they launch and 'go up' quite fast, but eventually their solid fuel is burnt through, they run out of force propelling them upwards, and they fall back to the earth.  Aside from usage within missiles chemical rockets are used as boosters which help move various objects into space.
            
            <!-- Solid Rocket Engines Are Used ... Missiles ... Boosters -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (19) </a>
            
            One example of booster usage is on Space Shuttles, and these boosters are a million pounds in weight.
            
            <!-- 1,000,000 lbs weight && shuttle usage -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (20) </a>
            
            As one should know a US Ton is 2,000 lbs which means one single booster rocket on a space shuttle weighs 500 Tons.  For perspective, a 2020 Toyota Prius weighs roughly 3,000 lbs or 1.5 Tons.
            
            <!-- Toyota Specs -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (21) </a>
            
            This means that each single solid thruster can be though to weigh the same as around 333 Prius.  Because of the massive weights that solid thrusters can reach, adding multiples of them to a space-crafts payload to ignite in succession would greatly increase the overall weight of the craft.  As a result the specific impulse of the craft would be greatly decreased in its initial stages.
            
            The overall weight of the solid-propellant is not the only drawback to this plan.  Solid-propelled rockets rely upon a pre-made propellant that continuously burns once ignited until there is no more fuel. If un-forseen circumstances arise over the duration of the mission necessitating re-orientation of the craft the previous fuel amount burnt in the main-engines may no longer be enough to get the craft to its destination.
            
            For these reasons of weight and static nature solid based propulsion is mainly used on Earth to help get space-craft into space.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            One benefit of electric propulsion is that Ion thrusters are able to regulate the amount of propellant released with their propellant management systems and therefore the amount of time they are active.
            
            <!-- Propellant Management System At Bottom -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (18) </a>
            
            Because of this they are able to achieve specific final velocities which is beneficial for the undertaking of more complex missions where specific velocities are required in order to achieve particular orbits of celestial bodies.  Due to the low amount of generated force of an electric thruster slight adjustments of trajectory are possible which is beneficial to avoid unnecessary collisons in areas where collisions may be common, such as in the Earth's satelite belt or an asteroid belt.
            
            <!-- Electric Propultion = Satelite Orbit Positioning -->

            &nbsp;
            
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> 18) </a>
            
            Next, due to unforseen circumstances and prolonged thruster usage during missions sensitive scientific instruments may be affected, and once they are out in space their repair may be impossible.  Electric thrusters do not generate a tremendous amount of force and as a result allow for sensitive scientific equipment to remain in a comparatively safe environment to those of chemical thrusters which can generate tremendous amounts of force.
            
            <!-- Gentle Non-Stop Thruster Usage -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (13)  </a>
            
            Additionally the Xenon fuel is inert and non-contaminating and can be used around sensitive optical surfaces.
            
            <!-- TA02-13 - Sensitive Optical Surfaces -->
            <a class = "source_num" href = "./sources.html"> (18) </a>
        
        </h5>
        
        <br>
        
        <h5 class = "text-left font-weight-normal">Comparing electric and liquid-based chemical thrusters is a different story.  Both of these forms of propulsion are able to regulate their propellant enabling a finer degree of accuracy in their final velocities.  Liquid chemical thrusters however have two different types of propellant onboard, the fuel and the oxidizer.

            The weight of fluid propellants can stack up.  In a space shuttle orbiter roughly 11,000 lbs of MMH fuel alone is carried.

            This single liquid fuel on the orbiter weighs 5.5 US Tons is significantly less than that of solid-propellant, but still can be thought of as roughly 4 Prius cars.  In comparison the Xenon propellant on the Dawn spacecraft only weighed 937 lbs.

            This is roughly 0.5 US Tons, or one third of a Prius car.  By carrying less fuel the overal weight of the craft is decreased and thereby the specific impulse of the craft is increased. Because of this for longer in-space voyages using electric propulsion is once again more efficient.
            
            Finally, again, Electric thrusters do not generate a tremendous amount of force comparatived to those of chemical thrusters which can generate large amounts of force.

            Additionally the Xenon fuel is inert and non-contaminating and can be used around sensitive optical surfaces.

            which greatly increases the overall mass of the craft.  Additionally because both propellants are draining at specific rates the calculation of the force being applied to the craft at a specific time becomes complex.  Electric thrusters use a single gaseous propellant which has considerably less weight than two liquid propellants.  The force calculation of the craft is made much simpler through its use.  Once again, the chemical propulsion imparts a large amount of heat in proximity to equipment which may have detrimental effects where the electric thruster does not.
